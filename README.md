     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your database and AWS credentials:
     ```env
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=healthtech
     DB_USERNAME=root
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password

     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
     AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
     AWS_BUCKET=healthtech-app
     ```

4. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. **Seed the Database**:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

7. **Set Up AWS Resources**:
   - **S3 Bucket**:
     - Create an S3 bucket for file storage:
       ```bash
       aws s3 mb s3://healthtech-app --region us-east-1
       ```
   - **SNS Notifications**:
     - Set up an SNS topic for SMS notifications in the AWS Management Console.
     - Add the ARN of the topic to the `.env` file:
       ```env
       AWS_SNS_TOPIC_ARN=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:HealthTechAppTopic
       ```

8. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## **AWS Configuration**
### S3 Integration
- Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with valid credentials:
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```
- Use S3 for storing uploaded files by configuring Laravelâ€™s `filesystems.php`:
  ```php
  's3' => [
      'driver' => 's3',
      'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
      'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
      'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),
      'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),
  ],
  ```

### SNS Integration
- Create an SNS topic in AWS:
  - Go to the [SNS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/).
  - Create a new topic (e.g., `HealthTechAppTopic`).
  - Copy the topic ARN to your `.env` file.
